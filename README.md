# Sketch 2:  Winding Road

**Using Twine 2.0, create one of the following:**

1. A miniature “choose your own adventure” text-based adventure
2. A non-linear poem
3. A dream sequence

## Rules

1. A typical user should be able to complete your Twine sketch in **under 2 minutes**. You can use as many Twine "passages" as you would like.
2. You sketch should not include image files,video, or sounds.
3. Your sketch must include:
    a. at least one variable
    b. at least one randomized function (a "random" or "either") or macro
    c. at least one twine or HTML tag (or twine feature) that we didn't discuss in class
4. Submit your sketch as an HTML document uploaded to GIThub with comments (in Twine, use the "Archive" button)


## Learning Objectives

1. Develop understanding of markup tags, variables, random functions
2. Create interactive experiences using a limited set of creative tools
3. Teach yourself new tricks


## Notes

If you're stumped, here are some things to try out:

1. Adapt a pre-existing children’s story, fairy tale, or nursery rhyme, imagining how the narrative path might potentially branch out or diverge at certain points.
2. Try asking one or several friends about their dreams and transcribe their accounts. Find potential points of overlap within their different dream stories. Pay close attention to objects, items, feelings, and objectives that might change within the dream(s).
3. Read a choose-your-own adventure book and diagram its structure.
